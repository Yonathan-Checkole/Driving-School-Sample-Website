                Our classes help teach our students the laws and mechanics of
                driving. This one month course occurs two times a week where one
                of our wonderful lecturers will teach a 20 person classroom.
                This is a required to take if you wish to use any of our other
                services.

              <p>
                We provide practice written tests and the DOL written test to
                all our students. Our practice driving tests emulate exactly
                what you will see in a DOL written test. Our written tests
                provide you with a variety of questions you will see in the
                official test.

              <p>
                Our top of the line driving simulator replicates what you will
                see on the road in the classroom. It is great to understand the
                ways of the road before actually driving on them. It is also
                great to help learn maneuvers like parallel parking. Our
                simulator is as simple as turning on a computer and just like
                that, you are behind the wheel.

              <p>
                Our students are able to sit in the backseat of one of our cars.
                You will be able to observe a fellow classmate or lecturer
                drive. This will help teach you how others react to certain
                situations. If a student is not driving, you will be able to get
                a lesson from the lecturer on the road.

                what you will see in a DOL driving test. Soon enough, you will
                be ready to take the official test with the lecturer you have
                driven hours with.

                All questions are accepted and do not have to do with the tests.
                Our tutors will help you make sure you know everything behind
                the wheel. We have plenty of tutors available in our building
                all you have to do is schedule an appointment with them.
